AntiAdvertiser
==============

**AntiAdvertiser** stops advertisers from advertising.

See project on Bukkit Dev: [AntiAdvertiser on dev.bukkit.org](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/antiadvertiser/)

I am no longer actively maintaining this project (adding features or fixing minor bugs). If you're a developer and would like to contribute, please submit a pull request - I still check those.

The **master** branch is the primary branch for development, and **stable** is the version currently available for download from Bukkit Dev. Unless otherwise noted, both branches should be safe to run in a production environment.
