Contributing to AntiAdvertiser
==============================

Hi there! Glad to hear you're willing to help out with AntiAdvertiser. Please take some time to read this page before creating an issue report or a pull request.

Reporting an issue
------------------
So you've found a bug in AntiAdvertiser. What do you do?

To report an issue, use our [issue tracker](https://github.com/MrEinStain/AntiAdvertiser/issues/new). The title should briefly describe the issue you're experiencing (don't name it "I found a bug", describe the bug). You are expected to use the following template when reporting an issue:

```markdown
**Version of AntiAdvertiser:** (paste the output of "/version AntiAdvertiser" here)

**Version of Bukkit:** (paste the output of "/version" here)

**Steps to reproduce the bug:**
* Step one
* Step two
* ...

**What did you expect to happen?**

**What actually happened?**

(Any extra information here)
```

An example of a good issue report with the title "IPs not blocked on signs":

> **Version of AntiAdvertiser:** 1.0
>
> **Version of Bukkit:** git-Spigot-1357
>
> **Steps to reproduce the bug:**
> * Place a sign
> * Put an IP address on the sign
>
> **What did you expect to happen?** The IP should have been blocked.
>
> **What actually happened?** The IP appeared on the sign and the advertiser wasn't kicked.
>
> My config.yml: http://pastebin.com/G4d9bbaC

Properly formatted issue reports mean we can spend more time fixing bugs and less time figuring out what the problem actually is.

Making a feature request
------------------------
If you feel AntiAdvertiser is lacking a feature, you can submit a feature request.

Just like with bug reports, use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/MrEinStain/AntiAdvertiser/issues/new) to submit feature requests. The title should briefly describe what you'd like added. Make sure to explain **in detail** what you'd like us to add and **justify**. Why would the feature be suitable for AntiAdvertiser?
